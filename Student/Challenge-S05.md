# Challenge S-05: Security Campaigns (Advanced)

## Description

You've been fixing vulnerabilities one alert at a time. Now zoom out. Security campaigns let you group related alerts across an entire codebase, assign them to developers, set a deadline, and track remediation progress in a dashboard. It's the difference between a developer heroically fixing one SQL injection versus a team systematically eliminating the entire class of injection vulnerabilities in a coordinated sprint.

As the developer who just spent the last few challenges in the code, you're in the best position to scope a campaign: you know which vulnerability classes are most prevalent, which are highest risk, and roughly how much effort each fix takes. Use that knowledge to design a campaign that's actually achievable.

**Important:** Security campaigns require a GitHub Team plan (or higher) with a Code Security license at the **organization** level. If you have access, create a real campaign. If not, design one on paper — the thinking is the same, and the written output is still valuable evidence that you understand the workflow.

## Objectives

- Review the remaining open alerts across all categories from your earlier challenges
- Decide on a campaign scope: which vulnerability class would you tackle first if you were running this as a real remediation sprint? Justify your choice.
- If org access is available: navigate to **Security Overview** at the org level, create a campaign, set a name, description, and due date, and add at least 5 relevant alerts to it
- If org access is unavailable: write a campaign plan document covering: scope (which alert types), assignees (which team roles), timeline, definition of done, and how you'd track progress
- Track or document progress: which alerts are fixed, which are in progress, which are deferred and why

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Campaign scope defined and justified with rationale (risk, volume, effort)
- [ ] **Option A:** Security campaign created with name, due date, and at least 5 alerts scoped — progress tracked in the campaign view
- [ ] **Option B (no org access):** Written campaign plan covering scope, assignees, timeline, and definition of done
- [ ] Reflection written: what would you prioritize in a real production codebase, and why?

## Copilot Tips

- Paste your list of remaining alerts and ask: *"If I were running a 2-day security sprint, which of these would you prioritize and in what order? Explain your reasoning."*
- Ask: *"What's a good definition of done for a SQL injection remediation campaign?"*
- Ask: *"Draft a campaign description I could use for a GitHub Security Campaign targeting injection vulnerabilities in a Node.js/Express application."*
